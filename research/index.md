# Research 

{: .welcomefont}
My current and past research combines truly interdisciplinary technologies integrating mechanistic modelling, network modelling, machine learning, and wet-lab experiments, and seeks to expand our frontiers in the following areas:  
* Constructing biophysically and biochemically detailed digital twins of the human heart
* Optimizing treatment strategy for heart rhythm disorders via personalized simulations
* New applications of heart-like cells induced from patient-derived stem cells: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Platform integrating iPSC-CM system, computational modeling, and machine learning for screening antiarrhythmic drugs
* Dissecting electro-mechanical coupling and feedback in the heart and its contribution to arrhythmia
* Heart-torso model for studying ventricular arrhythmias and electrocardiograms (ECGs) and their responses to stressors
* Sex differences in cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia
* Untangling subcellular signalling network in arrhythmia mechanisms
* Molecular and structural mechanisms of sinoatrial node dysfunction
