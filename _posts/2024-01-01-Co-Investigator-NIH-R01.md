**Jan. 2024.** New NIH R01 with PI (Glukhov) has received the notice of award. Haibo will participate in the project as a Co-investigator. Congrats to the team!    <!--more--> 

**Title**: Functional Microdomains in the Heart's Pacemaker: A New Dimension of Cardiac Remodeling


**Major goals** This project aims to determine the cellular, molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms of mechanical regulation of the sinoatrial node, the primary natural pacemaker of the heart. Our work will define how specialized cardiac cell membrane mechanosensitive domains and associated signaling molecules contribute to both physiological regulation of the sinoatrial node and its remodeling and dysfunction during chronically elevated mechanical overload in hypertension. 


<!-- Here, we built a novel computational framework for simulating electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling in human atrial cardiomyocytes and tissues, and their regulation by key upstream  -->
