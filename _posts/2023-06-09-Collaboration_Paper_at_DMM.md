**June. 2023.** Our most recent collaborative paper with Drs Colas and Ocorr (Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla) is online at ***Disease Models & Mechanisms***. Congrats to the team!    <!--more--> 

We integrated a multiplatform modeling of atrial fibrillation by combining 1) human iPSC-derived atrial-like cardiomyocytes, 2) the Drosophila heart model, and 3) computational model of human atria. As proof of concept, we screened 20 AF-associated genes and identified Phospholamban loss of function as a top conserved hit that shortens action potential duration and increases the incidence arrhythmia phenotypes upon stress. Mechanistically, our study reveals that Phospholamban regulates rhythm homeostasis by functionally interacting with L-type calcium channels and NCX. In summary, our study illustrates how a multi-model system approach paves the way for the discovery and molecular delineation of gene regulatory networks controlling atrial rhythm with application to AF.
