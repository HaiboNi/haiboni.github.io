**Title**: Multiomic and Functional Analysis of PVC-Driven Idiopathic VF Predicts New Druggable Targets  

In this project, We aim to unravel the mechanistic bases of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation by combining multiomic data, functional phenotyping, and computational modeling, and to use this knowledge to inform new antiarrhythmic strategies.


<!-- Here, we built a novel computational framework for simulating electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling in human atrial cardiomyocytes and tissues, and their regulation by key upstream  -->
