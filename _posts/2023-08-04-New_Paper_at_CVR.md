**Aug. 2023.** Our most recent paper is online at ***Cardiovascular Research***. Congrats to the team!    <!--more--> 

Here, we built a novel computational framework for simulating electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling in human atrial cardiomyocytes and tissues, and their regulation by key upstream signaling pathways (i.e., protein kinase A, PKA, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, CaMKII) involved in AF-pathogenesis. Populations of atrial cardiomyocyte models were constructed to determine the influence of subcellular ionic processes, signaling components, and regulatory networks on atrial arrhythmogenesis. Our results reveal a novel synergistic crosstalk between PKA and CaMKII that promotes atrial cardiomyocyte electrical instability and arrhythmogenic triggered activity. Simulations of heterogeneous tissue demonstrate that this cellular triggered activity is further amplified by CaMKII- and PKA-dependent alterations of tissue properties, further exacerbating atrial arrhythmogenesis. Our analysis reveals potential mechanisms by which the stress-associated adaptive changes turn into maladaptive proarrhythmic triggers at the cellular and tissue levels and identifies potential anti-AF targets. Collectively, our integrative approach is powerful and instrumental to assemble and reconcile existing knowledge into a systems network for identifying novel anti-AF targets and innovative approaches moving beyond the traditional ion channel-based strategy.
